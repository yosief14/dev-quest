  # Dev Quest 🧙‍♂️
  
  ##  This is my implementation of the frontend mockups from [Frontend-Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/devjobs-web-app-HuvC_LP4l) that I'm repurposing   . 
  A webapp you can use as a hub for job application tracking. ✍🏽 
  I wanted to use my favorite bleeding edge tools and try out new ones to make something I'll use everyday. There are plenty of great job trackers out there, and I have an unresaonable     amount of minor grievances with all of them. This is my solution.
